# Features

- Add Todos: Users can add new tasks to their todo list.
- Mark as Complete: Tasks can be marked as completed by clicking the checkbox. Completed tasks are visually distinguished by crossing them over for clarity.
- Crossover Feature: When a task is marked as completed, the text is automatically crossed over, giving a clear indication of its status.
- Edit Todos: Users can edit the text of existing tasks. When in edit mode, the taskâ€™s text is highlighted, and a "Save" button allows users to confirm changes.
- Delete Todos: Users can delete tasks from the list, removing them permanently.
- Real-Time Sync: Todo list data is stored in Firebase and updated in real-time across all connected devices.
- Responsive Design: The app is fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

# Tutorial

This project was initially based on a tutorial from the YouTube channel [Code Commerce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drF8HbnW87w). The tutorial covered the basic structure of a Todo List app using React.js, Firebase, and Tailwind CSS. The implementation extends the tutorial by adding a task crossover feature upon completion and an enhanced edit task functionality.
